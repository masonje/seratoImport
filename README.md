# seratoImport
This script will read all of the music files from the users music folder sub folders and crete a ~~symbolic link~~ copy into the "~/Music/_Serato_/Auto Import" folder. 

The imported files will be tracked in a "~/Music/imported_files.txt" file to limit importing the same saved file more than once. To import the file again, either edit the file and removed the song file out of the list or delete whole file to import everything again.

Save this scrip where you want to store it. Open a terminal and run:

`bash serntoImportMusic.sh`

This script has no warranty on use and is free to use to anyone. Backup your music before running. Enjoy!`
